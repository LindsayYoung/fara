Foreign Agent Registration Act Spreadsheet Guide



Here's your field guide on how to use the Sunlight Foundation's Foreign Influence Explorer data!

This data is the hand-entered, structured and normalized version of the Foreign Agent Registrant Act (FARA) files found in PDF format at http://www.fara.gov/. You may use Excel or any spreadsheet reader to open and read them, making it possible to easily search and analyze the information in ways that the PDF format precludes.

Below is a brief description of the information included in the spreadsheets.


A few key definitions that will help you navigate these files:

Registrant is the individual or organization enlisted to represent a foreign interest in the United States. These individuals or entities are sometimes, but not always, lobbyists. They can also be public relations firms, tourism organizations or business associations, among other things.  

Client is the foreign interest being represented. Sometimes foreign entities can represent themselves, which means the client and the lobbyist can be one and the same.

Most dates are directly transcribed form the document. Dates with an asterisk display the end date of the six-month reporting period because no date was given for that item. If the month but no day was provided, the date is reported as the first day of the month. If a date range was reported the date is represented as the first date of that range.

Your download will include some if not all of the following files:



CONTACTS:
 
This data contains descriptions of lobbying contacts, press releases, meetings, conferences speeches and other activity reported in the FARA forms.
	
This is among the most valuable information that can be obtained via FARA because unlike lobbyists who represent domestic clients, representatives for foreign interests must name lawmakers, staff members and even journalists whom they meet on behalf of their client. 

Explanation of Contact fields:

'Date', the date of the contact
'Contact Title', the title of the person contacted (Note: this may change over time)
'Contact Name', the name of the person contacted
'Contact Office', the office for which person contacted works. Contact Agency, the agency or category of the contact, such as White House or Media
'Client', the client represented by the registrant, (can be the same as the registrant)
'Client Location', the client's self-identified home base – this not always an officially recognized state) 
'Registrant', the person or organization that is filing, the foreign agent
'Description', a summary of the contact (give example), if provided
'Type', This describes the nature of the contact in certain broad categories, such as phone, email, meeting, other or unknown
'Employees Mentioned', individuals associated with the registrant who were mentioned in the contact summary
'Affiliated Member CRP ID', This is the unique identifier issued to members of Congress by the Center for Responsive Politics and would be used to identify contacts with that member as well as with his or her staff. 
'Affiliated Member Bioguide ID', This is the unique identifier issued to members of Congress by the government and would be used to identify contacts with that member as well as with his or her staff
'Source', link to original document
'Contact ID', an id for each person or organization contacted
'Record ID', an id for each contact record


CONTRIBUTIONS

Though foreign donations are barred from federal elections, U.S. citizens and organizations that represent foreign interests in the U.S. may still contribute to candidates and campaigns. They must report these donations, however, to the Justice Department under FARA.

 Note: These figures will NOT match records available at the Federal Election Commission, in Sunlight's Influence Explorer or Center for Responsive Politics/Open Secrets. The reason: These contributions are self-reported by the registrant, while contribution records made available via the FEC are reported by political campaigns.  Because the FARA records have a different data source, the dates and amounts often will not match.

Nonetheless, FARA political donation information is valuable because it bypasses the painstaking name-matching process required when fusing, campaign finance records and lobbying records for individuals and organizations that represent domestic clients and causes. The FARA records allow users to easily and reliably determine when someone from a lobbying or public relations organization is making campaign donations to the same political offices that they are contacting on behalf of a foreign client. (This is a common practice that is highlighted in this data.)

Explanation of Contribution fields:

'Date', the date of the contribution
'Amount', the dollar amount of the contribution
'Recipient', the campaign, PAC or individual receiving the contribution
'Registrant', the person or organization that is filing, the foreign agent
'Contributing Individual or PAC', the name of the PAC or person making the contribution
'Affiliated Member CRP ID', This is the unique identifier issued to members of Congress by the Center for Responsive Politics and would be used to identify contributions to that member.* 
'Affiliated Member Bioguide ID', This is the unique identifier issued to members of Congress by the government and would be used to identify contributions to that member.* 
'Source', link to original document 
'Record ID', an id for each contribution record 

*In the case of leadership PACs, the member's ID is assigned to the PAC with the name of the PAC in the Recipient field



PAYMENTS

These numbers tell you how much a foreign government, company or other entity is paying the firms or individuals representing it in the United States. The client field represents a payment on behalf of the client. (In rare cases, other entities foot the bill for services.) 

Explanation of Payment fields–

'Client', the client represented by the registrant, (can be the same as the registrant)
'Amount', the dollar amount of the payment
'Date', the date of the payment
'Registrant', the person or organization who is filing: the foreign agent
'Purpose', description of the payment, if given
'From subcontractor', a name is listed if the payment is coming from another registrant. Keep this in mind if trying to total clients, so that you do not count the same money twice
