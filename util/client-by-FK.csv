In addition to a House reception held in his honor in the Rayburn House Office Building that evening, Mr. Siew also had private meetings with eight U.S. Senators, and happened to meet informally another ten senators over the course of the day. Prior to October 3rd, 2007, Mr. D'Amato sent out a number of invitations to U.S. Members of Congress, asking them to meet Mr. Siew on that day. He also made follow-up phone calls. Through until October 18th (the date of termination of the registration), Senator D'Amato sent personal thank-you notes to the 42 Members who did meet Mr. Siew. While we did not save copies of every invitation and thank-you letter, we have included a master list of those Members who received invitations, copies of 19 invitations, and 14 thank-you letters - which were to Members and which are illustrative of the content and form of all such correspondence sent from our office. In anticipation of meeting, Mr. Siew, several Members' staffs asked for background memos. Please also see attached copies of two such memos (e.g. memos to the offices of Senators Lieberman and McConnell), all of which followed the same template. Other offices required more specific follow-up, as per the sample e-mail communication with Senator Max Baucus' staff. We have included copies of those congressional still in our possession. Park Strategies also twice reached out to Executive Branch officials on Mr. Siew's behalf. This included a September 2007 call to White House Staffer Neal Burnham to inquire as to whom at the U.S. Department of Commerce might be willing to meet Mr. Siew during his October 2007 visit to Washington, D.C. Upon learning that Mr. Siew would be meeting Assistant Secretary of Commerce David Bohigian, we sent Mr. Bohigian a courtesy advisory e-mail (a copy of which in included here). On October 2nd, Park Strategies issued the attached press release in anticipation of Mr. Siew's visit. The release was sent by to roughly 100 recipients, mainly New York, U.S. and Asian media outlets, as well as various academics and business organizations. In response to the press release, Bloomberg-TV's Zeb Eckert called on October 4th, seeking an interview with Mr. Siew (which ultimately did not occur).
