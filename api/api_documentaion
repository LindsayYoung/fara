Reminder- I needed to un-install simple json to get it to work

api/doc/form_id
	Retrieves document Model info on that particular form

api/docs 
	Returns all documents most recent first
	(will add doc type as kwarg, wouldn't that be fun?)
api/regdocs
	Finds all documents for a given registrant; searches by FARA Registration ID.
