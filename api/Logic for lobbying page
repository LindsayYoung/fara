Logic for lobbying page:

list of the latest documents to replace: http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/admin/reporting/post/

	get the last 20 or 50 from api/docs endpoint
	- it would be cool to have tabs for different document types
	display the stamp date
	use the reg_id to query the api/registrant/ endpoint and find Registrant Name and client information



from that page, pass the form_id to create the page,



report page to replace a page like: http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/fara/4980

	use /api/doc/ endpoint to find:
		stamp date
		processed
		doc type
		reg_id
		url to original document

	display document

	Try to look up registrant by api/registrant/ endpoint for basic info like reg name and clients

	if processed == True:
		link_chunk = link[25:-4].replace("_", "-")

		look up:
			api/contactbydoc/link_chunk/
   			api/contribbydoc/link_chunk/
   			api/paymentbydoc/link_chunk/
   			api/disbursementbydoc/link_chunk/
