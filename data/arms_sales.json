The U.S. Army will not replace the CH-47D aircraft being proposed for sale and transfer to the ROK. This proposed sale will allow the U.S. Army to avoid transportation and/or demilitarization costs in the amount of approximately $13.4 million.\nThis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by meeting the legitimate security and defense needs of an ally and partner nation. The ROK continues to be an important force for peace, political stability and economic progress in North East Asia.\nThe proposed sale will improve the ROK\u2019s capability to meet current and future requirements for troop movement, medical evacuation, aircraft recovery, parachute drop, search and rescue, disaster relief, fire-fighting and heavy construction support. The ROK will use this enhanced capability to strengthen its homeland defense, deter regional threats, and improve humanitarian and disaster mobilization and response. These efforts support both ROK and U.S. interests and objectives, and are consistent with strategic and regional goals. This sale is also consistent with the U.S. strategic interests for stability in the Pacific Command Area of Operations.\nThe ROK is capable of absorbing and maintaining this additional equipment in its inventory. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.\nThe principal contractor will be The Boeing Company in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.\nImplementation of this proposed sale will require the assignment of 18 U.S. Government or contractor representatives to the ROK to provide support, program management, and training for a period of up to 2 years.\nThere will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.\nThis notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded.\n-30-\n \n\n", "pdf_url": "http://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/mas/korea_13-66.pdf", "amount": null, "location": "South Korea", "dsca_url": "http://www.dsca.mil//major-arms-sales/republic-korea-ch-47d-aircraft", "date": "2013-12-03", "print_url": "http://www.dsca.mil/print/478", "location_id": 309}}, {"pk": 76, "model": "arms_sales.proposed", "fields": {"title": "Republic of Korea (ROK) \u2013 Support for the KF-16 Upgrade (Phase 1) ", "text": "\nRepublic of Korea (ROK) \u2013 Support for the KF-16 Upgrade (Phase 1) \n\nMedia/Public Contact:\u00a0Lorna Jons (703) 604-6618Transmittal No:\u00a013-62\u00a0WASHINGTON, Nov 25, 2013 \u2013 The Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress today of a possible Foreign Military Sale to the Republic of Korea for Phase 1 upgrades of 134 KF-16C/D Block 52 aircraft and associated equipment, parts, training and logistical support for an estimated cost of $200 million.\nThe Republic of Korea has requested a possible sale for Phase 1 of an upgrade of 134 KF-16C/D Block 52 aircraft to be completed in a potential two-phased approach.
