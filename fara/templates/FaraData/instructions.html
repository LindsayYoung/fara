<h2>Data Entry tips</h2>
<p>You can copy and paste into all text fields. Don't worry if it looks ugly, extra spaces and line breaks will be removed. For currency fields commas and dollar signs, leading and trailing whitespace will be removed.
</p>
<p>When adding dates, if they don't supply a date, leave it blank. If the date is a range, give the first date. If the date does not give a day use the first. Use the date-picker calendar to ensure dates are properly formated.
</p>
<p>For now, keep track of duplicates on <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/sunlightfoundation.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtVSwQeyEuFIdHJYQjVmanBXc3dJRFVEVk9SZUZUVWc#gid=2">this spreadsheet.</a> Everyone with a Sunlight gmail should have access. The tab corresponds to the category that has the dupe.

<h2>Instructions on data fields</h2>
<a id="Registrant"></a><h3>Registrant</h3>
<p> A registraint is the entity filling out the form. Usually it is a lobbying firm, PR firm or individual. If a registraint is representing itself, fill out the information in the registrant section and the client section.
</p>
<p>If the system is showing the incorrect id for the Registrant you need to fix this in the "Document" model of the admin. You can find the form by id. The id for the document is the number in the data form url.
</p>

<a id="Lobbyist"></a><h3>Lobbyist</h3>
<p>This is someone working for the registrant. We identify lobbyists when they make contacts or contributions, you don't have to enter everyone who appears in questions 5(a) and 5(b) of the supplemental.
</p>
<p>Try to make sure the lobbyist is not already in the system before adding a new lobbyist to the system. Try searching just the last name to make sure a lobbyist is not already in the system.
</p>

<a id="Client"></a><h3>Client</h3>
<p>This is who the registrant is lobbying on behalf of. 
</p>
<p>Try not to create new clients if they are already in the system. Always search existing clients before adding a brand new client to the database. Try typing the name without articles like "the" to see if the client is in the system under a slightly different name.
</p>
<p>Try to keep the same entities as the same client. For example, the Australian Embassy and the Embassy of Australia are the same. However, different departments of the same institution may be represented separately. The Ecuadorian Embassy and The Ecuadorian Ministry of Tourism would be septate clients. There can only be one client with the same name.
</p>
<p>New clients will be added when they appear on questions 8 or 9 or the supplemental or the AB form. When clients are no longer represented, they do not appear as clients, they are transfered to terminated clients.
</p> 
<p>Client registration forms (AB forms) also have identify the type of client and a description of the registrant's work for the client. Client Types are : Foreign government, Foreign political party, Intividual, Partnership, Corportation, Association, Committee, Voluntary Group. If they choose other, write down what is specified next to the box.
</p>
<p>See explanation of location for clients <a href="#Location">here</a>.
</p>

<a id="Terminated_Client"></a><h3>Terminated Client</h3>
<p>When a client is no longer being represented by a firm, mark them as a terminated client. This will happen when a client appears in question 7 of the supplemental or if a client that has been represented by the registrant and is longer reported in questions 8 and 9 of the supplemental.
</p>
<p>Only delete clients when they should never have been assigned to the client in the first place- a data entry error or some freak amendment.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may have to add a client in the database first, to then transfer it to the terminated clients.
</p>

<a id="Activity_Services"></a><h3>Activity and Services</h3>

</p>
<p>Enter contact with media, press releases etc. but you don't need to document the client's own publications. This is generally in propaganda files and we haven't been tracking. If you don't know if it should be added, ask or be safe and add it anyways.

<h2>Explanation of forms</h2>
<p>
<b>Registration Statement</b> is the first filing for the person or organization who lobbies on behalf of a foreign entity.
</p>
<p>The <b>Supplemental Statement</b> provides information on what kind of public relations and lobbying a firm engages in on behalf of a foreign government. Supplementals have key information like contacts, payments and contributions. These are filed every 6 months.
</p>
<p><b>Amendments</b> make corrections to past filings.
</p>
<p><b>Short Forms</b> are filed by each person involved in representing a foreign agent. (We don't enter all of these.)
</p>
<p><b>Exhibit A</b> to Registration Statement is filed for each foreign principle and gives an overview of the foreign organization.
</p>
<p><b>Exhibit B</b> to Registration Statement is the agreement between the foreign organization and the firm or person the organization hires. This usually contains a copy of the contract they sign. 
</p>
<p><b>Exhibit C</b> contains the Articles of incorporation, bylaws and other documents that pertain to the registrant, the person or company that represents the foreign agent.
</p>
<p><b>Exhibit D</b> outlines fund raising information on behalf of the foreign agent. 
</p>
<p><b>Conflict Provision</b>, a letter that is filed to allow a public official to represent a foreign entity. The employer must certify this position is to promote the national interest. These are very rare and might be worth writing about.
