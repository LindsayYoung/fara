	<a id="Tips"></a><h2>Data Entry Tips</h2>
	<section class="info">
		<ul>
			<li>
				You can copy and paste into all text fields. Don't worry if it looks ugly, extra spaces and line breaks will be removed. For currency fields commas and dollar signs, leading and trailing whitespace will be removed.
			<li>
				When adding dates, if they don't supply a date, leave it blank. If the date is a range, give the first date. If the date does not give a day use the first. Use the date-picker calendar to ensure dates are properly formated.
			<li>
				The "do not clear" check box does not relate to the data. It keeps the last entry up as a starting point for entering the next item. If you have repetitive entries, it may be faster and easier to use this feature. If you choose to use this feature, be careful to edit the entry correctly and not leave data that doesn't belong to the new entry. Correctness it top priority. 
		</ul>
	</section>
	

	<h2>Instructions on Data Fields</h2>
	
	<a id="Registrant"></a><h3>Registrant</h3>
	<section class="info">
		<p>
			A registraint is the entity filling out the form. Usually it is a lobbying firm, PR firm or individual. If a registraint is representing itself, fill out the information in the registrant section and the client section.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the system is showing the incorrect ID for the Registrant you need to fix this in the "Document" model of the admin. You can find the form by ID. The ID for the document is the number in the data form url.
		</p>
	</section>

	<a id="Lobbyist"></a><h3>Lobbyists</h3>
	<section class="info">
		<p>
			This is someone working for the registrant. We identify lobbyists when they make contacts or contributions, you don't have to enter everyone who appears in questions 5(a) and 5(b) of the supplemental.
		</p>
		<p>
			Try to make sure the lobbyist is not already in the system before adding a new lobbyist to the system. Try searching just the last name to make sure a lobbyist is not already in the system.
		</p>
	</section>

	<a id="Client"></a><h3>Clients</h3>
	<section class="info">
		<p>
			This is who the registrant is lobbying on behalf of. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Try not to create new clients if they are already in the system. Always search existing clients before adding a brand new client to the database. Try typing the name without articles like "the" to see if the client is in the system under a slightly different name.
		</p>
		<p>
			Try to keep the same entities as the same client. For example, the Australian Embassy and the Embassy of Australia are the same. However, different departments of the same institution may be represented separately. The Ecuadorian Embassy and The Ecuadorian Ministry of Tourism would be septate clients. There can only be one client with the same name.
		</p>
		<p>
			New clients will be added when they appear on questions 8 or 9 or the supplemental or the AB form. When clients are no longer represented, they do not appear as clients, they are transfered to terminated clients.
		</p> 
		<p>
			Client registration forms (AB forms) also have identify the type of client and a description of the registrant's work for the client. Client Types are: Foreign government, Foreign political party, Individual, Partnership, Corporation, Association, Committee, Voluntary Group. If they choose other, write down what is specified next to the box in 25 characters or less.
		</p>
		<p>
			See explanation of location for clients <a href="#Location">here</a>.
		</p>
	</section>

	<a id="Terminated_Client"></a><h3>Terminated Clients</h3>
	<section class="info">
		<p>
			When a client is no longer being represented by a firm, mark them as a terminated client. This will happen when a client appears in question 7 of the supplemental or if a client that has been represented by the registrant and is longer reported in questions 8 and 9 of the supplemental.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only delete clients when they should never have been assigned to the client in the first place- a data entry error or some freak amendment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes, you may have to add a client in the database first, to then transfer it to the terminated clients.
		</p>
	</section>

	<a id="Activity_Services"></a><h3>Activity and Services</h3>
	<section class="info">
		<p>
			This appears on question 11 of the supplemental. Usually it is a paragraph explaining services. Copy and paste the response. If it refers to contacts, you do not need to double enter the data.
		</p>
	</section>

	<a id="Contact"></a><h3>Contacts</h3>
	<section class="info">
		<p>
			These are meetings, phone calls, emails, letters or other forms of contact that appear on question 12 of the supplemental. Contacts are often include press, Congress or a governmental departments. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The recipient is the person that the registrant is attempting to contact. Add a lobbyist if he is mentioned in the contact, otherwise, leave this blank. Don't forget to select what client for the contact.
		</p>
		<p>
			Enter contact with media, press releases etc. but you don't need to document the client's own publications. This is generally in propaganda files and we haven't been tracking. If you don't know if it should be added, ask or be safe and add it anyways.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Check "do not clear" when you are doing repetitive contacts that have slight variations, that way you can make the new contact by editing the appropriate details from the last contact.
		</p>
	</section>

	<a id="Recipient"></a><h3>Recipients</h3>
	<section class="info">
		<p> 
			This is the target of the communication, gift or political donation. Watch 
		</p>
		<p>
			If there is a press release, the recipient is "media". Try to give a recipient to all categories that it is an option. If there is a contact that you cannot figure out a recipient for, you can use "unknown"-- but use it as sparingly as possible.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Congress members that are correctly in the system will appear as Sen. Firstname Lastname (Senate) or Rep. Firstname Lastname (House). 
		</p>

			<dt> Subcontractor
			<dd> Add when money is coming from another FARA registrant. You can figure this out by looking at the client's name. If the name says "through" or "via" a company, you that is the name you want in the subcontractor field. For example if the client says, the Royal Thai Embassy through Hill and Knowlton", add Hill and Knowlton as the subcontractor. (You may need to add a new registrant to the system.) This can get confusing so feel free to ask questions.
